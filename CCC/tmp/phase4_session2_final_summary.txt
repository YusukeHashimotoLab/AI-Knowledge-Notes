FORECAST
========
Phase 4 Complete: +6-10 hours (realistic scenario)
  - Worker2 metallic-materials Sessions 2-3: 3-4 hours
  - Worker1 advanced-materials-systems: Investigation + completion

MS Dojo Complete: +6-10 hours total (assuming Worker1 productive)

Alternative Scenario (if Worker1 unavailable):
  - Phase 4: +3-4 hours (Worker2 metallic-materials only)
  - Remaining work: Phase 3 synthesis-processes + Phase 4 advanced-materials-systems
  - May require Worker2/Worker3 reallocation

NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES
========================
1. Worker1 Investigation (URGENT - highest priority)
   - Determine status of advanced-materials-systems
   - Identify blockers or issues
   - Provide support or reallocate if necessary

2. Worker2 Session 2 Execution
   - metallic-materials Chapters 1-2
   - Estimated: 1.5-2 hours

3. Optional: Phase 3 completion (synthesis-processes)
   - If Worker1 available and productive
