## Implementation Strategy for Remaining Chapters

### Step 1: Safety Warnings (CRITICAL)
Add prominent safety sections at the beginning of each chapter with:
- Physical hazards specific to that chapter's content
- Emergency procedures
- Required safety equipment
- Prohibited actions

### Step 2: Code Safety Enhancements
All code examples must include:
```python
# Safety check example
def safe_robot_move(robot, target_position):
    # 1. Validate target is within safe workspace
    if not is_within_safe_zone(target_position):
        raise SafetyViolationError("Target outside safe zone")
    
    # 2. Check for obstacles
    if detect_collision_path(robot.current_pos, target_position):
        raise SafetyViolationError("Collision detected in path")
    
    # 3. Limit velocity for first-time operations
    if robot.first_run:
        velocity = SAFE_VELOCITY_SLOW
    else:
        velocity = NORMAL_VELOCITY
    
    # 4. Execute with watchdog
    try:
        robot.move_to(target_position, velocity, timeout=30)
    except TimeoutError:
        robot.emergency_stop()
        raise SafetyViolationError("Movement timeout - emergency stop")
```

### Step 3: Safety-Enhanced Quality Checklists
Each chapter gets a safety validation section:

- Post-operation verification
- Incident response procedures
- Regulatory compliance items

### Step 4: Practical Pitfalls (Domain-Specific)
8-10 safety-critical pitfalls per chapter with:
