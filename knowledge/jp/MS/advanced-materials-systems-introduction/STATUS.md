## Current Status: 50% Complete (Deferred)

### Completed Deliverables:
- index.html (689 lines, 29KB) ✅
- chapter-1.html structure adaptation (50% complete) 🔄

### Reason for Deferral:
Technical constraints: Full implementation requires 10-12.5 hours, which exceeds current project timeline (+5 hours to MS Dojo completion). Worker1 completed synthesis-processes-introduction (10,818 lines, Phase 3 contribution) as primary deliverable.

### Resumption Plan:
- Option A: Next phase continuation
- Option B: Dedicated session with realistic timeline
- Option C: Alternative worker assignment
