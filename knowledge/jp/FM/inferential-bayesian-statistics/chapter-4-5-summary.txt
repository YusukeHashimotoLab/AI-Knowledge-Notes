Creating Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 for the Inferential Statistics and Bayesian Statistics series.

Chapter 4: Bayesian Inference and MCMC (7 code examples)
- Bayes theorem and coin flip problem
- Conjugate priors (Beta-Binomial, Normal-Normal)
- Metropolis-Hastings implementation
- Gibbs sampling
- PyMC3 Bayesian inference
- Material properties Bayesian estimation
- Convergence diagnostics

Chapter 5: Hierarchical Bayesian Models and Applications (7 code examples)
- Hierarchical model structure with PyMC3
- Bayesian linear regression
- Bayesian logistic regression  
- Bayes factor for model selection
- Bayesian ANOVA
- Quality control with posterior distributions
- Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning

Both chapters will be approximately 1000+ lines each with full theory, code examples, and visualizations.
