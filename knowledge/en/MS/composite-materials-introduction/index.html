<h2>Series Overview</h2>
<p>
                Composite Materials are advanced materials that combine two or more different materials to achieve superior performance unattainable by single materials.
                They are widely applied in fields requiring lightweight and high-strength properties such as aerospace, automotive, sports equipment, and building structures.
                This series provides systematic learning from fundamental principles of composite materials through fiber-reinforced composites (CFRP/GFRP), particle and laminated composites, evaluation techniques, to Python implementation.
            </p>
<p>
<strong>Difficulty</strong>: Intermediate to Advanced<br/>
<strong>Expected reading time</strong>: 30-40 minutes per chapter (approximately 3 hours total for series)<br/>
<strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Fundamentals of materials mechanics, Python basics, understanding of stress-strain relationships
            </p>
<p>
                Each chapter includes executable Python code examples, exercises (Easy/Medium/Hard), and learning objective confirmation sections.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
<div class="faq-item">
<div class="faq-question">Q1: What are composite materials? How do they differ from single materials?</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
                    Composite materials are materials that macroscopically combine two or more different materials (reinforcement and matrix).
                    The reinforcement (fibers, particles) bears the load, while the matrix (resin, metal, ceramic) holds the reinforcement and transfers loads.
                    For example, carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) embeds carbon fiber (strength: 3-7 GPa) in epoxy resin (strength: 50-100 MPa),
                    achieving strength of 1-2 GPa in the fiber direction. Combinations of high strength, lightweight properties, and corrosion resistance unattainable by single materials are possible.
                </div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<div class="faq-question">Q2: What is the reinforcement mechanism of fiber-reinforced composites?</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
                    Reinforcement occurs through the <strong>load transfer mechanism</strong>. The matrix receives the load and transfers it to the fibers via interface shear stress.
                    Fibers have high elastic modulus (carbon fiber: 200-600 GPa), so they bear most of the load.
                    According to the Rule of Mixtures, the longitudinal elastic modulus of composite materials is predicted by E_c = E_f V_f + E_m V_m (E: elastic modulus, V: volume fraction, f: fiber, m: matrix).
                    For CFRP with 60% fiber volume fraction, the composite elastic modulus reaches approximately 130-160 GPa. This is covered in detail in Chapter 1.
                </div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<div class="faq-question">Q3: What are the differences between CFRP and GFRP?</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<strong>CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic)</strong> uses carbon fiber as reinforcement and features high strength, high stiffness, and lightweight properties.
                    Carbon fiber has a density of 1.8 g/cm³, tensile strength of 3-7 GPa, and elastic modulus of 200-600 GPa. It is used in aerospace, racing cars, and high-end sports equipment.
                    <strong>GFRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastic)</strong> uses glass fiber as reinforcement and features low cost, electrical insulation, and corrosion resistance.
                    Glass fiber has a density of 2.5 g/cm³, tensile strength of 2-3 GPa, and elastic modulus of 70-85 GPa. It is widely used in ships, building materials, and automotive parts.
                    Chapter 2 covers detailed comparisons and application examples.
                </div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<div class="faq-question">Q4: What is Classical Laminate Theory?</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
                    Classical Laminate Theory (CLT) is a theory that predicts the mechanical behavior of laminates.
                    It extends the stress-strain relationships of each layer (ply) to the entire laminate, expressed by the A-B-D matrix (Extensional-Coupling-Bending stiffness matrix).
                    The <strong>A matrix</strong> represents in-plane stiffness, <strong>B matrix</strong> represents extension-bending coupling, and <strong>D matrix</strong> represents bending stiffness.
                    For symmetric laminates [0°/90°/±45°]_s, the B matrix becomes zero, making extension and bending independent.
                    Chapter 2 covers Python implementation and laminate configuration optimization.
                </div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<div class="faq-question">Q5: What are Metal Matrix Composites (MMC)?</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
                    Metal Matrix Composites (MMC) are materials that disperse ceramic particles or fibers in a metal matrix (Al, Ti, Mg).
                    A representative example is SiC particle-reinforced aluminum (SiC/Al), which exhibits wear resistance, high stiffness, and low thermal expansion coefficient.
                    Through the <strong>Orowan mechanism</strong>, the stress required for dislocations to bypass particles increases, enhancing strength.
                    Orowan stress is given by Δσ = 0.4 M G b / λ (M: Taylor factor, G: shear elastic modulus, b: Burgers vector, λ: particle spacing).
                    Applications include automotive engine parts and brake discs. Chapter 3 covers this in detail.

<div class="faq-item">
<div class="faq-question">Q6: What types of failure modes do composite materials exhibit?</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
                    Composite materials exhibit three main failure modes:
                    <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-left: 1.5rem;">
<li><strong>Fiber Breakage</strong>: Fibers fracture under tensile load. Determines longitudinal strength.</li>
<li><strong>Matrix Cracking</strong>: Cracks occur in the matrix. Prominent under transverse or shear loads.</li>
<li><strong>Delamination</strong>: Separation occurs between layers. Likely to occur under compression or impact loads.</li>
</ul>
                    Failure modes depend on load direction, laminate configuration, and interface strength. Chapter 4 covers fracture analysis and non-destructive evaluation.
                </div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<div class="faq-question">Q7: How are fatigue properties of composite materials evaluated?</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
                    Fatigue properties are evaluated using <strong>S-N curves (Stress-Number of cycles curve)</strong>.
                    Repeated loads are applied, and the number of cycles to failure (N) is plotted against stress amplitude (S).
                    Unlike metals, composite materials do not have a clear fatigue limit, and damage gradually accumulates even in low-stress regions.
                    Fatigue life is predicted by Paris law: da/dN = C(ΔK)^m (a: crack length, ΔK: stress intensity factor range, C, m: material constants).
                    Chapter 4 covers S-N curve fitting and Goodman diagram creation in Python.
