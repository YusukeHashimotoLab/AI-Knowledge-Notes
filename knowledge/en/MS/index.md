## 🎓 About Materials Science Dojo

The Materials Science Dojo provides **comprehensive education in materials characterization, processing, properties, and advanced materials systems**. Learn essential materials science techniques including XRD analysis, spectroscopy, mechanical testing, materials processing, and additive manufacturing through integrated theory and Python implementation. 

**Features:** Each series follows a "Fundamentals → Characterization → Data Analysis → Python Implementation" structure, combining classical materials science with modern computational approaches. All code examples are executable and designed for hands-on learning. Progress from basic crystallography to advanced materials design systematically.
