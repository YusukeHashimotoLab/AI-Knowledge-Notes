## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to explain:

### Basic Understanding

  * Strengthening and toughening mechanisms of structural ceramics (transformation toughening, fiber reinforcement)
  * Physical origins and crystal structures of functional ceramics (piezoelectric, dielectric, magnetic)
  * Biocompatibility and bone bonding mechanisms of bioceramics
  * Mechanical properties of ceramics and statistical fracture theory (Weibull distribution)

### Practical Skills

  * Analyze the strength distribution of ceramics (Weibull statistics) using Python
  * Calculate phase diagrams and optimize sintering conditions using pycalphad
  * Calculate and evaluate piezoelectric constants, dielectric constants, and magnetic properties
  * Select optimal ceramics for specific applications using material selection matrices

### Application Capability

  * Design optimal ceramic composition and microstructure based on application requirements
  * Design functional ceramic devices (sensors, actuators)
  * Evaluate biocompatibility of bioceramic implants
  * Perform reliability design of ceramic materials (probabilistic fracture prediction)
