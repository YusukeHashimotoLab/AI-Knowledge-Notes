<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
<div class="faq-item">
<div class="faq-question">Q1: What are the differences between ceramics and metals/polymers?</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
                    Ceramics are primarily composed of ionic or covalent bonds, characterized by high-temperature stability, chemical resistance, and electrical insulation (or specific conductivity).
                    While metals excel in ductility and malleability, ceramics have high hardness but are brittle. Polymers are lightweight with excellent processability, but
                    ceramics remain stable even in high-temperature and corrosive environments.
                </div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<div class="faq-question">Q2: Why are ceramics brittle?</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
                    The brittleness of ceramics stems from the directional nature of ionic and covalent bonding and the difficulty of dislocation motion.
                    In metals, dislocations move easily to enable plastic deformation, but in ceramics, dislocation movement is restricted,
                    causing cracks to propagate rapidly due to stress concentration. Griffith theory explains how microscopic defects dominate strength.
                </div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<div class="faq-question">Q3: What is the perovskite structure?</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
                    The perovskite structure (ABO₃ type) is a crystal structure where large cations occupy the A site, small cations occupy the B site, and oxygen ions occupy the O sites.
                    Found in ferroelectrics like BaTiO₃ (barium titanate) and dielectric materials like SrTiO₃, it exhibits diverse functions including piezoelectricity, dielectric properties, and magnetism.
                    This will be covered in detail in Chapter 1.
                </div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<div class="faq-question">Q4: What is the sintering process?</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
                    Sintering is a process where powdered ceramics are heated to high temperatures to form bonds between particles and achieve densification.
                    In solid-state sintering, densification progresses through grain boundary diffusion and volume diffusion, while in liquid-phase sintering, it occurs through mass transfer via the liquid phase.
                    The sintering temperature, time, and atmosphere determine the final microstructure and properties. Details will be covered in Chapter 2.
                </div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<div class="faq-question">Q5: What is Weibull statistics?</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
                    Weibull statistics is a statistical method for describing the strength distribution of ceramics.
                    Since ceramic strength is controlled by microscopic defects and varies significantly between specimens,
                    probabilistic evaluation is necessary. The Weibull modulus (shape parameter) provides quantitative evaluation of material reliability.
                    Statistical analysis methods and Python implementation will be covered in Chapter 3.
                </div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<div class="faq-question">Q6: What are piezoelectric ceramics?</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
                    Piezoelectric ceramics are materials that generate voltage under mechanical stress (piezoelectric effect) or deform under applied voltage (inverse piezoelectric effect).
                    PZT (lead zirconate titanate) is representative and is applied in sensors, actuators, and ultrasonic devices.
                    The principles and applications of piezoelectric properties will be covered in Chapter 4.
                </div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<div class="faq-question">Q7: What are ionically conductive ceramics?</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
                    Ionically conductive ceramics are solid electrolytes that conduct specific ions (O²⁻, Li⁺, etc.) at high speeds.
                    They are applied as electrolyte materials in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) (YSZ: yttria-stabilized zirconia) and
                    as electrolytes in all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries. Conduction mechanisms and material design will be covered in Chapter 4.
