## Exercises

Exercise 1: Program Model Selection Medium

**Problem:** A mid-sized country (population ~50 million, moderate R&D budget) wants to establish a national Materials Informatics program. Based on the program models discussed, recommend an approach and justify your choice.

**Solution:**

**Recommended Approach:** Hybrid model combining Data Infrastructure + Industry Partnership

**Justification:**

  * **Resource Efficiency** : A mid-sized country lacks resources for comprehensive government-led coordination like MGI
  * **Leverage Existing Data** : Rather than building new databases, focus on data infrastructure that connects to international repositories (OPTIMADE integration)
  * **Industry Relevance** : Partnership model ensures practical relevance and co-funding
  * **Scalability** : Can start small and expand based on success

**Implementation Steps:**

  1. Establish national materials data platform with FAIR compliance and OPTIMADE API
  2. Form industry consortium with 5-10 leading companies (co-funding requirement)
  3. Partner with existing international initiatives (NOMAD, Materials Project) rather than duplicating
  4. Focus on 1-2 priority material classes aligned with national industrial strengths

Exercise 2: Funding Trend Analysis Medium

**Problem:** Based on the timeline and funding data presented, calculate the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of global MI investment from 2011 to 2025. What does this suggest about future investment levels by 2030?

**Solution:**

**Given Data:**

  * 2011 baseline: ~$200M (MGI + Materials Project launch)
  * 2025 annual: ~$800M (sum of regional annual estimates)
  * Period: 14 years

**CAGR Calculation:**

$$ CAGR = \left(\frac{V_{final}}{V_{initial}}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1 = \left(\frac{800}{200}\right)^{\frac{1}{14}} - 1 = 10.4\% $$

**2030 Projection (assuming continued CAGR):**

$$ V_{2030} = 800 \times (1.104)^5 = 800 \times 1.64 = \$1.31B \text{ annually} $$

**Interpretation:** If current trends continue, annual MI investment will exceed $1.3 billion by 2030, with cumulative investment since 2011 reaching approximately $15 billion.

Exercise 3: Strategic Comparison Hard

**Problem:** Compare the strengths and weaknesses of Japan's industry-integrated approach (CoSMIC) versus the EU's FAIR-focused approach (NOMAD/FAIRmat). Under what circumstances would each approach be more effective?

**Solution:**

**Japan's CoSMIC Approach:**

Strengths| Weaknesses  
---|---  
Direct industry relevance| Limited public access to data/tools  
Co-funding sustainability| Potential IP barriers to academic collaboration  
Faster commercialization| Focus on incremental improvements  
Trained industry workforce| Domestic focus limits international impact  
  
**EU's NOMAD/FAIRmat Approach:**

Strengths| Weaknesses  
---|---  
Broad scientific impact| Slower path to commercialization  
International collaboration| Sustainability dependent on continued public funding  
Reproducibility and transparency| Industry engagement may lag  
Foundation for future discovery| Data quality control challenges  
  
**Optimal Contexts:**

  * **CoSMIC approach preferred when:** Strong existing industrial base, need for near-term competitiveness, IP-sensitive applications
  * **NOMAD/FAIRmat approach preferred when:** Building long-term scientific capacity, fostering international collaboration, enabling fundamental discovery

**Optimal Strategy:** Most successful ecosystems (like the US) combine both approaches, with open infrastructure enabling fundamental discovery while industry partnerships accelerate translation.

Exercise 4: Future Scenario Planning Hard

**Problem:** By 2030, autonomous laboratories and foundation models may fundamentally change materials discovery. Describe three scenarios (optimistic, moderate, pessimistic) for how this could impact traditional materials research, and recommend strategies for researchers to prepare for each.

**Solution:**

**Scenario 1: Optimistic (Accelerated Discovery)**

  * Autonomous labs achieve 100x acceleration in synthesis optimization
  * Foundation models reliably predict novel material properties
  * **Impact:** Materials discovery becomes primarily computational; experimental validation is routine
  * **Researcher Strategy:** Develop expertise in AI/ML, focus on high-level design questions and application domains

**Scenario 2: Moderate (Augmented Research)**

  * Autonomous labs handle routine optimization; humans guide strategy
  * Foundation models useful but require domain expertise to apply correctly
  * **Impact:** Hybrid human-AI workflows become standard; productivity increases 5-10x
  * **Researcher Strategy:** Build skills in both traditional materials science and AI tools; become "AI-augmented" expert

**Scenario 3: Pessimistic (Limited Progress)**

  * Autonomous labs struggle with complex synthesis; reliability issues persist
  * Foundation models underperform on novel materials outside training distribution
  * **Impact:** Incremental improvement; traditional expertise remains essential
  * **Researcher Strategy:** Maintain deep domain expertise; selectively adopt tools where proven effective

**Robust Preparation Regardless of Scenario:**

  1. Develop computational literacy (Python, ML basics, database access)
  2. Understand AI/ML limitations and appropriate applications
  3. Build experimental intuition that complements computational predictions
  4. Contribute to data infrastructure to ensure quality training data exists
