## Exercises

Exercise 1: Regional Comparison Easy

**Question:** Compare the MI approaches of Singapore (A*STAR) and Australia (CSIRO). What are the key differences in their organizational structures and research focus areas?

**Solution:**

**Singapore (A*STAR):**

  * Centralized research through dedicated institutes (IMRE, IHPC)
  * Cluster-based organization (Materials & Energy, Electronics)
  * Strong industry partnership focus with multinational corporations
  * Focus: Electronics, advanced manufacturing, energy materials

**Australia (CSIRO):**

  * Division-based organization (MM&M division)
  * Specialized computational methods (SOMs, network analysis)
  * Strong PhD training programs (iPhD with industry placement)
  * Focus: Mining/resources, energy, environmental materials

**Key Difference:** Singapore emphasizes industry-ready applications in electronics/manufacturing, while Australia focuses on resource-sector applications and computational method development.

Exercise 2: Investment Analysis Medium

**Question:** China's total AI investment is projected at approximately 400 billion yuan by 2025, while Singapore's RIE2025 plan allocates S$25 billion over 5 years. Calculate the per-capita investment for each country (assume China population: 1.4 billion, Singapore population: 5.9 million). What does this comparison reveal about different national strategies?

**Solution:**

**Per-capita calculations:**

  * China: 400B yuan / 1.4B people = ~286 yuan/person (~$40 USD)
  * Singapore: S$25B / 5.9M people = ~S$4,237/person (~$3,100 USD)

**Analysis:**

  * Singapore's per-capita investment is approximately 77x higher than China's
  * This reflects different strategies: China leverages scale and volume, while Singapore focuses on intensity and concentration
  * Singapore's small size enables concentrated investment in focused clusters
  * China's absolute investment creates massive infrastructure despite lower per-capita spending

Design a collaboration strategy that engages partners in at least three Asia-Pacific countries. Consider: (1) Complementary capabilities, (2) Funding mechanisms, (3) Data sharing frameworks, and (4) Student exchange opportunities.
