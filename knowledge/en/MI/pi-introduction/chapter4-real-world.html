<h2>2. Five Success Stories</h2>
<h3>2.1 Case Study 1: Catalytic Process Optimization</h3>

<h2>Practice Problems</h2>
<h3>Problem 1 (Difficulty: easy)</h3>

- What results were obtained</p>
<details>
<summary>Example answer (for distillation column optimization)</summary>

**Challenge**:
Distillation columns in petroleum refining plants account for up to 50% of energy consumption, costing hundreds of millions of yen annually. The goal was energy reduction while maintaining quality (99.5% purity).

**PI utilization**:
- Aspen Plus simulation + multi-objective optimization (NSGA-II)
- Optimize reflux ratio, heating steam amount, column top pressure
- Search for Pareto optimal solutions, visualize quality-energy trade-offs

**Results**:
- Energy consumption: 10 MW → 6.2 MW (40% reduction)
- Annual cost reduction: approximately 800 million yen
- CO2 emission reduction: 15,000 tons/year

</details>

<hr />
<h3>Problem 2 (Difficulty: medium)</h3>
<p>Compare digital twins with traditional process simulation, listing three advantages and disadvantages each.</p>
<details>
<summary>Example answer</summary>

**Digital twin advantages**:
1. **Real-time integration**: constantly updated with IoT sensor data, synchronized with reality
2. **Improved prediction accuracy**: machine learning corrects model errors, 90%+ accuracy
3. **What-If analysis**: immediately simulate effects of condition changes during operation

**Digital twin disadvantages**:
1. **High initial investment**: system construction costs hundreds of millions of yen, data infrastructure development required
2. **Operational costs**: ongoing cloud fees, data communication fees, maintenance costs
3. **Security risks**: cybersecurity concerns from cloud connections

**Traditional process simulation advantages**:
1. **Low cost**: software license only (several million yen annually)
2. **Offline analysis**: detailed examination possible at design stage
3. **Proven track record**: 40+ years of history, high reliability

**Traditional process simulation disadvantages**:
1. **Static**: snapshot-type analysis, cannot track time changes
2. **Manual model updates**: need periodic correction for reality drift
3. **No real-time optimization**: offline calculation only, cannot be used for operation optimization

</details>

<hr />
<h3>Problem 3 (Difficulty: hard)</h3>
<p>For a chemical process you are interested in (polymerization, fermentation, distillation, reaction, etc.), propose a concrete project plan for how PI could be utilized. Include the following:
- Problem setting
- PI approach (methods to be used)
- Expected results</p>
<details>
<summary>Example answer (for continuous crystallization process)</summary>

**Process**: Continuous crystallization process (pharmaceutical API crystallization)

**Challenge**:
- Difficult crystal size distribution (CSD) control (target: D50 = 100±10 μm)
- Low reproducibility in batch mode, ±30% variation
- 50% particle size change during scale-up (10L → 1000L)

**PI approach**:

1. **Data collection**:
   - Online particle size measurement with PAT (Process Analytical Technology) using FBRM (Focused Beam Reflectance Measurement)
   - History data of supersaturation, temperature, stirring speed, residence time (1,000 batches)

2. **Prediction model construction**:
   - LSTM to predict particle size distribution time evolution
   - Input: supersaturation history, temperature profile, stirring speed
   - Output: D50, D90 after 5, 10, 30 minutes

3. **Real-time optimization**:
   - Model Predictive Control (MPC) to dynamically adjust cooling rate
   - Constraints: supersaturation < 1.5 (prevent nucleation burst)
   - Objective: D50 = 100 μm, minimize CSD width

4. **Population Balance Model (PBM) integration**:
   - Describe crystal nucleation, growth, agglomeration with physical model
   - Estimate PBM parameters (nucleation rate, growth rate constant) with machine learning

**Expected results**:

**Quality improvement**:
- Particle size control precision: D50 = 100±30 μm → 100±5 μm (6x precision)
- CSD width: D90/D10 = 3.5 → 2.0 (more uniform crystals)
- Scale-up success rate: 50% → 90%

**Productivity improvement**:
- Batch time reduction: 8 hours → 6 hours (-25%)
- Yield improvement: 80% → 92% (recrystallization reduction)

**Economic impact**:
- Defect reduction: 200 million yen/year (rework cost reduction)
- Market competitiveness: differentiation with high-quality crystals
- Regulatory compliance: achieve FDA-required CQA (Critical Quality Attributes)

</details>

<hr />
<h3>Problem 4 (Difficulty: hard)</h3>
<p>From a sustainability DX perspective, design a PI project to reduce CO2 emissions in chemical processes. Include the following:
- Specific approaches for CO2 reduction
- How to handle trade-offs between performance (yield, quality) and CO2 reduction
- Economic evaluation (considering carbon tax)</p>
<details>
<summary>Example answer (for ammonia synthesis process)</summary>

**Project name**: Multi-objective optimization of green ammonia synthesis

**Challenge**:
- Traditional Haber-Bosch process: CO2 emission 1.9 tons/ton-NH3 (accounts for 1% of global emissions)
- High temperature and pressure (450°C, 200 bar) with massive energy consumption
- Hydrogen source is fossil fuels (natural gas steam reforming)

**CO2 reduction approach**:

1. **Green hydrogen utilization**:
   - Hydrogen production via water electrolysis (renewable energy-derived)
   - CO2 emissions: fossil fuel-derived 1.5 → 0.2 tons/ton-H2

2. **Reaction condition optimization**:
   - PI optimizes temperature and pressure to improve energy efficiency
   - Bayesian optimization maximizes catalyst activity (lower temperature and pressure)

3. **Process integration**:
   - Reaction heat recovery rate: 60% → 85% (heat exchange network optimization)
   - Unreacted gas recycling rate: 90% → 98%

**Multi-objective optimization setup**:

**Objective functions**:
- Objective 1: minimize manufacturing cost (yen/ton-NH3)
- Objective 2: minimize CO2 emissions (tons-CO2/ton-NH3)

**Variables**:
- Reaction temperature: 350-500°C
- Reaction pressure: 100-250 bar
- H2/N2 ratio: 2.5-3.5
- Catalyst type: Fe-based, Ru-based, Co-Mo-based

**Constraints**:
- Ammonia yield ≥ 15% (ensure economic viability)
- Catalyst lifetime ≥ 2 years (consider replacement cost)
- Safety: pressure < 250 bar

**Handling trade-offs**:

Example Pareto optimal solutions:
| Case | Temp[°C] | Press[bar] | Yield[%] | CO2[tons/ton] | Cost[yen/ton] |
|------|----------|------------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| A (traditional) | 450 | 200 | 18 | 1.9 | 50,000 |
| B (low-carbon) | 380 | 150 | 15 | 0.5 | 65,000 |
| C (balanced) | 420 | 180 | 17 | 0.8 | 55,000 |

**Economic evaluation (considering carbon tax)**:

**Scenario 1: Carbon tax $50/ton-CO2**
- Case A: manufacturing cost 50,000 + carbon tax 9,500 = 59,500 yen/ton
- Case B: manufacturing cost 65,000 + carbon tax 2,500 = 67,500 yen/ton
- **Conclusion**: Case A advantageous (traditional process)

**Scenario 2: Carbon tax $100/ton-CO2**
- Case A: manufacturing cost 50,000 + carbon tax 19,000 = 69,000 yen/ton
- Case B: manufacturing cost 65,000 + carbon tax 5,000 = 70,000 yen/ton
- **Conclusion**: nearly equivalent, Case B selected for environmental value

**Scenario 3: Carbon tax $150/ton-CO2**
- Case A: manufacturing cost 50,000 + carbon tax 28,500 = 78,500 yen/ton
- Case B: manufacturing cost 65,000 + carbon tax 7,500 = 72,500 yen/ton
- **Conclusion**: Case B advantageous (low-carbon process)

**Expected results**:
- CO2 reduction: 1.9 → 0.5 tons/ton-NH3 (approximately 73% reduction)
- Economically viable at carbon tax $100+
- Response to 2030 green ammonia market (5 million tons/year)
