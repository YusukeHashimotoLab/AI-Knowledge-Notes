**Can AI/MI technology really be used? A practical guide to learning through actual industrial application cases**

## Series Overview

This series is a practical educational content in four chapters that allows you to learn how Materials Informatics (MI) and AI technologies are actually utilized in industry and what results they have achieved, along with specific examples from companies and research institutions.

Not just theory, we provide detailed explanations of **executable Python code examples** , **actual company names and numerical data** , and **processes to success** , allowing you to learn while thinking about "how to apply this to your own research and work."

**Features:**

  * ✅ **Actual success stories** : 20+ cases including Exscientia, Toyota, BASF, NASA
  * ✅ **Quantitative data** : Specific numbers such as development period reduction from 10→1 year, cost reduction to 1/10
  * ✅ **Implementable code** : 13 fully functional Python code examples
  * ✅ **Broad fields** : Comprehensive coverage from drug discovery, batteries, catalysts, semiconductors to space development
  * ✅ **Latest trends** : Technology trends as of 2025 and vision for 2030

**Total Learning Time** : 85-100 minutes (including code execution and exercises)
