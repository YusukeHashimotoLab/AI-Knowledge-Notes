<h2>2. Five Success Stories</h2>
<h3>2.1 Case Study 1: Lithium-Ion Battery Materials Discovery</h3>

<h2>Exercises</h2>
<h3>Problem 1 (Difficulty: easy)</h3>
<p>Select one of the five cases introduced in this chapter and explain the following:
- What challenges existed
- How was MI utilized
- What results were obtained</p>
<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Consider Case Study 2 (catalyst materials) as an example. There was a clear challenge of finding alternative materials to platinum.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Answer Example (Catalyst Materials Case)</summary>

**Challenge**:
Catalysts used in hydrogen production and fuel cells require platinum (Pt), which is expensive (approximately 4,000 yen/g) and rare, necessitating low-cost, high-activity alternative catalysts.

**MI Utilization**:
- Predict hydrogen adsorption energy using first-principles calculation (DFT)
- Efficiently select next experimental candidates using Bayesian Optimization
- Discover optimal composition in 10-20 experiments

**Results**:
- Mo-Co-N system: reduced Pt usage by 50%, activity 120%
- Development period: 2 years → 3 months (approximately 8x faster)
- Cost reduction: catalyst price reduced by 80% (1 million yen/kg → 200,000 yen/kg)

</details>
<hr/>
<h3>Problem 2 (Difficulty: medium)</h3>
<p>Compare self-driving labs with conventional human-led laboratories and list three advantages and disadvantages for each.</p>
<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Consider from perspectives of speed, cost, and creativity.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Answer Example</summary>

**Self-Driving Lab Advantages**:
1. **24-hour operation**: no human labor hour constraints, experiments continue on holidays
2. **Acceleration**: synthesize and evaluate 41 materials in 17 days (approximately 10x human speed)
3. **Reproducibility**: minimize experimental errors through precise robot control

**Self-Driving Lab Disadvantages**:
1. **High initial investment**: approximately 100 million yen equipment introduction cost
2. **Low flexibility**: difficult to automate complex synthesis procedures (high-temperature processing, etc.)
3. **Lack of creativity**: difficult for human intuitive discoveries

**Conventional Laboratory Advantages**:
1. **Flexibility**: can respond immediately to unexpected results
2. **Creativity**: can try new ideas with human intuition
3. **Low initial cost**: utilize existing equipment and personnel

**Conventional Laboratory Disadvantages**:
1. **Labor hour constraints**: operate only 8 hours/day, 5 days/week
2. **Reproducibility issues**: errors easily occur due to experimenter variation
3. **Low throughput**: can evaluate only about 10-100 materials per year

</details>
<hr/>
<h3>Problem 3 (Difficulty: medium)</h3>
<p>In a materials field of interest (batteries, catalysts, semiconductors, polymers, etc.), propose how MI can be utilized with a concrete project plan. Include the following:
- Problem definition
- MI approach (methods to use)
- Expected outcomes</p>
<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Apply examples from this chapter to your field of interest.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Answer Example (Semiconductor Materials Case)</summary>

**Field**: Transparent Conductive Oxide (TCO)

**Challenge**:
- Smartphone touch panels require transparent and highly conductive materials
- Current mainstream material ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) uses rare and expensive indium
- Difficult to balance transparency (visible light transmittance &gt;80%) and conductivity (resistivity &lt;10^-4 Ω·cm)

**MI Approach**:
1. **Data collection**: Obtain bandgap and electrical conductivity data for 100,000 oxide materials from Materials Project
2. **Prediction model construction**: Predict the following using Graph Neural Networks (GNN)
   - Bandgap (transparency indicator: 3.0-3.5 eV optimal)
   - Carrier concentration (conductivity indicator)
3. **Screening**: Narrow from 100,000 types to 100 types that balance transparency and conductivity
4. **Multi-objective optimization**: Also consider cost (avoid rare elements)
5. **Experimental validation**: Synthesize and measure top 10 types

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Discovery of indium-free TCO (e.g., Sn-Zn-O system)

<details>
<summary>Answer Example (Choosing Industry)</summary>

**Choice**: Industry (MI Engineer at major chemical manufacturer)

**Reasons**:

**1. Salary and Economic Rewards**:
- Higher salary than academia (annual 7-10M yen vs. 5-7M yen)
- Stable employment (for large companies)
- Economic stability important for supporting family

**2. Research Freedom**:
- Themes align with company business strategy, but MI field is broad enough to be acceptable
- Short-term results required, but that becomes my motivation

**3. Social Impact**:
- Direct impact on society as products reach market
- Example: battery material improvement → EV adoption → CO2 reduction
- More attractive "visible form" contribution than academic papers

**4. Lifestyle**:
- Want to avoid academia's long working hours (nighttime/weekend research)
- Emphasize work-life balance (time with family)
- Industry (varies by company) but relatively stable schedule

**5. Personal Values**:
- More interested in "solving social issues" than "research for research sake"
- Value team achievements over academic competition (paper count, citations)
- Want sense of accomplishment in 10 years: "products I worked on are used worldwide"

**Conclusion**:
Want to contribute to practical materials development while maintaining stable life as industry MI Engineer. However, keep option of future startup transition, continuously learning latest technologies.

<h3>Problem 5 (Difficulty: hard)</h3>
<p>We stated that "sustainability-driven design" will become important as a future MI trend. Design an MI project considering sustainability in a materials field of interest. Include the following:
- Specific environmental burden indicators (CO2 emissions, toxicity, recyclability, etc.)
- How to handle performance and sustainability tradeoffs
- Social and economic impact</p>
<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Apply Section 3.3 "Sustainability-Driven Design" to a specific material system.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Answer Example (Plastic Packaging Materials Case)</summary>

**Project Name**: Multi-objective Optimization of Biodegradable Plastics

**Challenge**:
- Global plastic waste: 300 million tons/year, ocean leakage 10 million tons
- Conventional plastics (PE, PP) take hundreds of years to decompose
- Biodegradable plastics (PLA, PHA) have low performance (strength, heat resistance)

**Environmental Burden Indicators**:
1. **CO2 emissions**: Carbon footprint during manufacturing (kg-CO2/kg)
   - Conventional PE: approximately 2.0 kg-CO2/kg
   - Target: &lt; 1.0 kg-CO2/kg
2. **Biodegradability**: Decomposition rate after 6 months (%)
   - Conventional PE: &lt; 5%
   - Target: &gt; 90%
3. **Toxicity**: Toxicity to microorganisms and aquatic life (LC50 value)
   - Conventional PE: low toxicity but microplastics problematic
   - Target: completely harmless (including decomposition products)

**Performance Indicators**:
- Tensile strength: &gt; 30 MPa (PE is 35 MPa)
- Heat resistance: &gt; 80°C (food packaging use)
- Cost: &lt; 300 yen/kg (PE is 200 yen/kg)

**MI Approach**:
1. **Data collection**:
   - Polymer literature data (5,000 types)
   - Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) database
2. **Multi-objective optimization model**:
   - Predict strength, heat resistance, biodegradability using Random Forest
   - Visualize Pareto front (performance vs. environmental burden tradeoff)
3. **Constraints**:
   - Exclude toxic substances (phthalates, BPA, etc.)
   - Don't use rare elements
4. **Experimental validation**:
   - Select 10 types from Pareto optimal solutions
   - Synthesis, measurement, LCA evaluation

**Tradeoff Handling**:
- **Case 1 (High performance focus)**: Strength 35 MPa, decomposition rate 70%, CO2 1.2 kg-CO2/kg
  - Use: Industrial packaging (recycle after short-term use)
- **Case 2 (Environmental focus)**: Strength 28 MPa, decomposition rate 95%, CO2 0.8 kg-CO2/kg
  - Use: Agricultural mulch film (decomposes in soil)
- **Case 3 (Balance type)**: Strength 32 MPa, decomposition rate 85%, CO2 1.0 kg-CO2/kg
  - Use: Food packaging (convenience store lunch boxes, etc.)

**Expected Outcomes**:
- 50% CO2 emission reduction while maintaining performance
- Mitigate ocean plastic problem
- Market size: biodegradable plastic market predicted to reach 1 trillion yen in 2030
- Regulatory compliance: meets EU plastic regulations

**Social and Economic Impact**:
- Environmental: protect marine ecosystems, reduce carbon emissions
- Economic: create new markets, generate employment
- Policy: contribute to SDG Goal 12 (sustainable consumption and production), Goal 14 (ocean resources)
