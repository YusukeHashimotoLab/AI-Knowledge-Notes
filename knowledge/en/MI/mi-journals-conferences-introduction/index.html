<div class="faq-item">
<div class="faq-question">Q7: What is the meaning and limitations of Impact Factor?</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<strong>A</strong>: Impact Factor (IF) indicates journal influence but has limitations.<br/>
<strong>Definition</strong>: Average number of times papers published in the past 2 years were cited in the current year<br/>
<strong>Calculation Example</strong>: Papers from 2022-2023 cited 10 times on average in 2024 → IF = 10.0<br/>
<strong>Advantages</strong>: Objective comparison possible, quick grasp of journal influence<br/>
<strong>Limitations</strong>:<br/>
                - IF range varies by field (Materials Science: 2-40, Mathematics: 0.5-3)<br/>
                - Journals with many review papers tend to have higher IF<br/>
                - New journals have low IF due to lack of track record (InfoMat achieved IF 22.0 in 3 years since launch)<br/>
                - Citation count ≠ Research quality<br/>
<strong>Recommendation</strong>: Use IF as one reference, and comprehensively consider journal reputation, review quality, editorial board, and quality of published papers.
