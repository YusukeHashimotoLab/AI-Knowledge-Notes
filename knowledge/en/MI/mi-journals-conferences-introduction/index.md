Q6: What are the best practices for paper writing?

**A** : We recommend the following structure:  
**Abstract** : Background 1 sentence + Method 1 sentence + Main results 2-3 sentences + Significance 1 sentence (total 150-200 words)  
**Introduction** : Background and challenges, prior work review, research gap, objectives and novelty of this study  
**Methods** : Reproducible detail level, dataset, computational settings, tool versions used  
**Results** : Figure-centered, clear captions for each figure, objective description (discussion in Discussion section)  
**Discussion** : Interpretation of results, comparison with prior work, limitations and future challenges  
**Conclusion** : 3 main findings, scientific and practical significance  
**Figures/Tables** : Captions understandable from paper alone, high resolution (300 dpi or higher), consider color universal design 

Q7: What is the meaning and limitations of Impact Factor?

**A** : Impact Factor (IF) indicates journal influence but has limitations.  
**Definition** : Average number of times papers published in the past 2 years were cited in the current year  
**Calculation Example** : Papers from 2022-2023 cited 10 times on average in 2024 → IF = 10.0  
**Advantages** : Objective comparison possible, quick grasp of journal influence  
**Limitations** :  
\- IF range varies by field (Materials Science: 2-40, Mathematics: 0.5-3)  
\- Journals with many review papers tend to have higher IF  
\- New journals have low IF due to lack of track record (InfoMat achieved IF 22.0 in 3 years since launch)  
\- Citation count ≠ Research quality  
**Recommendation** : Use IF as one reference, and comprehensively consider journal reputation, review quality, editorial board, and quality of published papers. 

Q8: Is using preprint servers recommended?

**A** : Yes, strongly recommended. Especially arXiv and ChemRxiv are useful.  
**Advantages** :  
\- Can publish research results before peer review (secure priority)  
\- Obtain feedback from research community  
\- Increased visibility (cited before journal publication)  
\- Free  
**Major Preprint Servers** :  
\- **arXiv** (Physics, Mathematics, CS, Materials Science): https://arxiv.org/  
\- **ChemRxiv** (Chemistry, Materials Chemistry): https://chemrxiv.org/  
\- **bioRxiv** (Life Sciences, Biomaterials): https://www.biorxiv.org/  
**Note** : Some journals do not allow preprint publication, so check before submission (most major journals allow it). 

Q9: Are there support programs for students and early-career researchers?

**Prohibited Actions** :  
\- **Plagiarism** : Using others' text/ideas without citing sources  
\- **Data Fabrication/Falsification** : Fabricating or modifying data  
\- **Duplicate Publication** : Submitting same content to multiple journals  
\- **Salami Slicing** : Unnecessarily dividing one research into multiple papers  
**Recommendation** : Must read each journal's Ethical Guidelines before submission. Consult advisor or co-authors on unclear points. 

Q11: What are tips for English paper writing?

**A** : We recommend the following techniques:  
**1\. Simple English** : Avoid complex constructions, use simple subject-verb-object structure  
**2\. Active Voice** : "We calculated..." > "It was calculated..."  
**3\. Present Tense** : Introduction/Discussion, Past Tense: Methods/Results  
**4\. One Idea Per Sentence** : Don't pack multiple claims into one sentence  
**5\. Paragraph Structure** : Topic sentence + Supporting sentences + Concluding sentence  
**6\. Use Connectives** : However (contrast), Moreover (addition), Therefore (conclusion)  
**7\. Consistent Terminology** : Don't mix "machine learning" and "ML"  
**Tools** :  
\- Grammarly (grammar checking)  
\- DeepL Write (correction to natural English)  
\- Google Scholar (search for similar expressions)  
**Last Resort** : English editing services (Editage, AJE, etc., 30,000-50,000 yen) 

Q12: What should I do while waiting for review results after submission?

**A** : Make effective use of the waiting period.  
**1\. Start Next Research** : Since review period (2-6 months) is long, begin new projects  
**2\. Preprint Publication** : Publish submitted paper on arXiv or ChemRxiv (secure priority)  
**3\. Conference Presentation Preparation** : Present same content at conferences (check submission venue regulations)  
**4\. Create Anticipated Questions List** : Identify weaknesses reviewers might point out, prepare answers  
**5\. Plan Additional Experiments** : Prioritize additional experiments in preparation for Major Revision  
**6\. Track Related Papers** : Check new arrivals of related papers with Google Scholar Alert  
**Note** : Duplicate submission of same content to other journals is strictly prohibited. Only after rejection can you submit to another journal after revision.
