<h2>Series Overview</h2>
<p>This series is an educational content with a 4-chapter structure that allows you to learn progressively, from beginners learning Bayesian Optimization and Active Learning for the first time to those who want to acquire practical materials exploration skills.</p>
<p>Bayesian Optimization is the most efficient exploration technique for discovering optimal materials and process conditions with a limited number of experiments. As an innovative technology that can now achieve in just dozens of experiments what traditionally required thousands of experiments in materials development using random search or exhaustive exploration, it is rapidly spreading across all materials fields including Li-ion batteries, catalysts, alloys, and organic semiconductors.</p>
<h3>Why This Series is Necessary</h3>
<p><strong>Background and Challenges</strong>: The greatest challenge in materials development is the vastness of the search space. For example, in composition optimization of 5-element alloys, there are more than 10<sup>10</sup> candidates, making it physically impossible to try them all. With traditional methods relying on random search or empirical rules, development periods extend from years to decades, and costs become enormous.</p>
<p><strong>What You Can Learn in This Series</strong>: In this series, you will systematically learn from theory to practice of Bayesian Optimization and Active Learning through executable Code Examples and materials science case studies. You can acquire immediately practical skills including efficient exploration methods of search space, proposing next experiments by exploiting uncertainty, handling constraints and multi-objective optimization, and automatic integration with experimental equipment.</p>
