#### 🎯 What You Will Learn in This Series

**Composition-based features** are classical yet powerful methods for predicting material properties from chemical composition (types and ratios of elements). Centered on Magpie descriptors, this series systematically covers everything from utilizing elemental property databases to Python implementation with matminer.

## Series Overview

In materials discovery, **chemical composition is the most fundamental and important information**. However, a composition formula like "Fe2O3" alone cannot be input into machine learning models. This is where **composition-based features** play a crucial role by combining periodic table information (ionization energy, electronegativity, atomic radius, etc.) to convert composition into numerical vectors.

This series comprehensively covers the following, centered on the widely-used **Magpie descriptors** :

  * ✅ **Theoretical Foundation** : Mathematical definitions and materials science significance of composition-based features
  * ✅ **Practical Skills** : Feature generation workflows using the matminer library
  * ✅ **Comparative Analysis** : When to use composition-based vs structure-based features (CGCNN/MPNN and other GNNs)
  * ✅ **Latest Trends** : Limitations of Magpie and evolution to GNN methods

## Why Composition-Based Features Are Important

#### 💡 Composition-Based vs Structure-Based

Material features have two main approaches:

  * **Composition-Based** (this series): Generate features from chemical composition only (no structure information required)
  * **Structure-Based** ([GNN Introduction Series](<index.html>)): Learn from 3D structures including atomic coordinates and bonding information

**Strengths of Composition-Based** : Effective for exploring new materials with unknown structures, high-speed screening, and cases with limited data

### Typical Applications of Composition-Based Features

  1. **High-Speed Materials Screening** : Formation energy prediction for 1 million compounds (10-100× faster than GNNs)
  2. **Experimental Data-Driven Exploration** : Property prediction from limited experimental data (combined with transfer learning)
  3. **Hybrid Models** : Improved accuracy by combining composition features + GNN features

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Q1: Should I use composition-based features or GNNs (structure-based)?

**A:** It depends on the task and data characteristics:

  * **Composition-based** advantages: (1) Materials discovery with unknown structures, (2) High-speed screening (1 million compound scale), (3) Limited data cases (<1000 samples)
  * **GNN** advantages: (1) Properties with strong structure dependence (elastic modulus, thermal conductivity), (2) Accuracy priority, (3) Sufficient data available (>10000 samples)
  * **Hybrid** is strongest: Using both composition and GNN features improves accuracy (implemented in Chapter 5)

Q2: Aren't 132 dimensions of Magpie descriptors too many? Concerns about overfitting?

**A:** This is rarely a problem in practice:

  * 132 dimensions is considered low in modern machine learning (GNNs learn thousands of dimensions in embeddings)
  * Elemental properties have physical meaning, unlike random high dimensions
  * Dimensionality reduction possible with regularization (L1/L2) or feature selection
  * Good performance reported experimentally even with 100-1000 samples

Q3: Are there libraries other than matminer?

**A:** Yes, these are available:

  * **DScribe** : SOAP, MBTR, ACSF descriptors (supports molecules and crystals)
  * **CFID** : Composition-based Feature Identifier
  * **Pymatgen** : matminer's foundation library (low-level API)
  * **XenonPy** : Integrates deep learning and feature generation

This series focuses on the most widely-used matminer.

Q4: Can Magpie descriptors be calculated automatically from chemical formulas (e.g., Fe2O3)?

**A:** Yes, it's easy with matminer:
    
    
    from matminer.featurizers.composition import ElementProperty
    
    featurizer = ElementProperty.from_preset("magpie")
    features = featurizer.featurize_dataframe(df, col_id="composition")
    # Automatically generates 132-dimensional vectors from df["composition"] column (Fe2O3, etc.)

Chapter 5 provides detailed code examples.

Q5: What is the prediction accuracy difference between GNNs (CGCNN, MPNN) and composition-based features?

**A:** Depends on the dataset and task, but representative benchmark results:

Task | Magpie + RF | CGCNN | Hybrid  
---|---|---|---  
Formation Energy (OQMD) | MAE 0.12 eV | MAE 0.039 eV | MAE 0.035 eV  
Band Gap (Materials Project) | MAE 0.45 eV | MAE 0.39 eV | MAE 0.36 eV  
Inference Speed (1M compounds) | 10 min | 100 min | 110 min  
  
Detailed comparison experiments are conducted in Chapter 5.

Q6: What are the differences between elemental property databases (Magpie/Deml/Jarvis)?

**A:** Characteristics of each database:

  * **Magpie** (Ward+ 2016): 22 elemental properties, most widely used, proven track record in Materials Project
  * **Deml** (Deml+ 2016): Considers oxidation states, particularly strong for oxides
  * **Jarvis** (Choudhary+ 2020): Includes DFT calculation values, latest elemental properties
  * **Matscholar** (Tshitoyan+ 2019): Element embeddings extracted from 2 million papers using NLP

Chapter 3 implements usage of each database.

Q7: Can composition-based features be used for transfer learning?

**A:** Yes, the following approaches are effective:

  * **Pre-training** : Train on Materials Project (60k compounds) → Fine-tune on experimental data (100 samples)
  * **Domain Adaptation** : Train on inorganic materials → Apply to organic-inorganic hybrids
  * **Meta-learning** : Learn common feature representations across multiple tasks (formation energy, band gap, elastic modulus)

Chapter 4 implements transfer learning using XGBoost and neural networks.

Q8: Can custom elemental properties (e.g., rarity, cost) be added?

**A:** Yes, you can create custom Featurizers by inheriting matminer's BaseFeaturizer:
    
    
    from matminer.featurizers.base import BaseFeaturizer
    
    class CustomElementProperty(BaseFeaturizer):
        def featurize(self, comp):
            # Reference custom elemental property database
            rarity = get_element_rarity(comp)
            cost = get_element_cost(comp)
            return [rarity, cost]

Chapter 3 provides detailed custom Featurizer implementation examples.

Q9: How is interpretability (Explainability) with composition-based features?

**A:** There are aspects that are easier to interpret than GNNs:

  * **SHAP Values** : Clear which elemental properties (e.g., average electronegativity) contributed to predictions
  * **Physical Meaning** : Chemical interpretations possible, such as "higher ionization energy leads to lower formation energy"
  * **Integration with Domain Knowledge** : Direct utilization of periodic table knowledge

Chapter 4 implements interpretability analysis using SHAP/LIME.
