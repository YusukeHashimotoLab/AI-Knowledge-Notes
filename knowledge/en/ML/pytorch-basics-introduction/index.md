## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

#### Q1: What are the differences between PyTorch and TensorFlow?

**A:** PyTorch adopts dynamic computation graphs, enabling intuitive Python-like coding. TensorFlow uses static computation graphs (TF 2.0+ also supports Eager Execution) and has strengths in deployment. PyTorch is widely used in research, while TensorFlow is common in production, though you can choose based on use case.

#### Q2: Is a GPU environment required?

**A:** CPU is fine for the learning phase. However, for large-scale models or image processing, having a GPU (CUDA-enabled) significantly speeds up training. You can practice without environment setup using Google Colab's free GPU.

#### Q3: How much learning time is required?

**A:** 100-120 minutes for all chapters. At a pace of one chapter per day (20-30 minutes), you can complete it in 5 days. Concentrated learning over the weekend is also possible. Understanding deepens by actually writing code as you progress.

#### Q4: Is there compatibility with NumPy?

**A:** Yes. PyTorch Tensors and NumPy ndarrays can be easily converted to each other. It's easy to migrate existing NumPy code to PyTorch, and many APIs are similar to NumPy.

#### Q5: What should I learn after this series?

**A:** We recommend proceeding to series that delve deeper into specific architectures, such as "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Introduction," "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) Introduction," or "Transformer Introduction."

#### Q6: Will I reach a level usable in practice?

**A:** This series solidifies PyTorch fundamentals. For practical work, you'll additionally need domain-specific expertise (images, text, audio, etc.), deployment, and optimization techniques. However, with these fundamentals, the bridge to practical application becomes smoother.
