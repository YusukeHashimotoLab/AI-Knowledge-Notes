## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

#### Q1: Can I learn LLMs without machine learning knowledge?

**A:** Basic machine learning knowledge (training, testing, loss functions, etc.) is recommended. If you lack this knowledge, we recommend first studying our "[Supervised Learning Introduction Series](<../supervised-learning-introduction/index.html>)" or "[Neural Networks Introduction](<../neural-networks-introduction/index.html>)".

#### Q2: What is the difference between ChatGPT and GPT-4?

**A:** ChatGPT is an application name, with GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 as the underlying model. GPT-4 is larger and more capable than GPT-3.5, enabling more complex reasoning and longer text understanding. This is explained in detail in Chapter 1.

#### Q3: What do I need to run the code?

**A:** Python 3.8 or higher, and libraries like transformers, torch, numpy, pandas are required. Using Google Colab eliminates the need for environment setup and provides free GPU access. Setup instructions are provided in each chapter.

#### Q4: Do I need a high-performance GPU to run LLMs?

**A:** For inference (using existing models), smaller models can run on CPU. GPUs are recommended for large models or fine-tuning, but you can try for free using Google Colab or Hugging Face Inference API.

#### Q5: What should I do after completing this series?

**A:** You can proceed to more specialized series such as "Transformer Details," "Fine-tuning in Practice," or "RAG Implementation." Also, applying LLMs to actual projects deepens understanding.

#### Q6: Are there restrictions on commercial use of LLMs?

**A:** Licenses vary by model. GPT-4 must comply with OpenAI API terms of service, LLaMA had research-only restrictions, but LLaMA 2 and later allow commercial use. This is explained in detail in each chapter.
