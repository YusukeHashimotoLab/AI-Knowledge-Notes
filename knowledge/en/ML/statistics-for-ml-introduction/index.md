**Master the theoretical foundation of machine learning by systematically learning statistics from the basics**

## Series Overview

This series is a practical educational content consisting of 5 chapters that allows you to learn the statistics necessary for machine learning step by step from the basics.

**Statistics** is an important academic field that forms the theoretical foundation of machine learning. You will systematically learn descriptive statistics that summarizes data characteristics, probability theory that quantifies uncertainty, statistical estimation that infers population properties from data, hypothesis testing that verifies the validity of hypotheses, and Bayesian statistics that utilizes prior knowledge. This knowledge is essential for understanding machine learning algorithms, evaluating models, and quantifying prediction uncertainty. Starting from mean and variance, you will learn probability distributions, estimation and testing, Bayesian statistics, and applications to machine learning with practical Python code examples.

**Features:**

  * ✅ **From Basics to Applications** : Systematic learning from descriptive statistics to Bayesian statistics
  * ✅ **Implementation-Focused** : 30+ executable Python code examples, utilizing NumPy/SciPy/Matplotlib
  * ✅ **Visual Understanding** : Intuitive understanding through histograms, box plots, and probability distribution visualizations
  * ✅ **Bridge to Machine Learning** : Clear demonstration of how to apply statistical knowledge to machine learning
  * ✅ **Practical Exercises** : Statistical analysis using real data, practice with hypothesis testing

**Total Learning Time** : 120-150 minutes (including code execution and exercises)
