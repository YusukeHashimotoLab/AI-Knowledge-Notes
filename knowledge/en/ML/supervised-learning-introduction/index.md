**From ML Fundamentals to Practice - Building Predictive Models that Learn from Data**

## Series Overview

This series is a practical educational content with 4 chapters that teaches **Supervised Learning** progressively from the basics.

**Supervised Learning** is a fundamental machine learning technique that learns from labeled data and makes predictions on unseen data. From the two main tasks of regression (numerical prediction) and classification (category prediction) to state-of-the-art ensemble methods, you'll master practical skills used in real-world applications.

**Features:**

  * ✅ **Balance of Theory and Practice** : Learn both mathematical background and implementation code
  * ✅ **Implementation Focused** : Over 40 executable Python code examples
  * ✅ **Latest Techniques** : XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost and other techniques used in practice
  * ✅ **Practical Projects** : Complete implementation of housing price prediction and customer churn prediction
  * ✅ **Kaggle Preparation** : Master techniques usable in competitions

**Total Learning Time** : 80-100 minutes (including code execution and exercises)
