**Master the core technologies of next-generation AI applications**

## Series Overview

This series is a practical educational content consisting of four comprehensive chapters designed to teach AI Agents systematically from fundamentals to advanced applications.

**AI Agents** are next-generation AI systems that autonomously perceive their environment, use tools, and take actions to achieve goals. By combining the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools and APIs, they can solve complex tasks step by step. Learn systematically from ReAct patterns and Chain-of-Thought to multi-agent collaboration - all the technologies necessary for modern AI agent development.

**Features:**

  * ✅ **From basics to practice** : Systematic learning from agent architecture fundamentals to advanced multi-agent systems
  * ✅ **Implementation-focused** : Over 20 executable Python code examples and practical design patterns
  * ✅ **Latest technologies** : Using industry-standard tools like OpenAI, Anthropic, and LangChain
  * ✅ **Applied learning** : Practical use cases including customer service, code generation, and research
  * ✅ **Design philosophy** : Design principles and best practices for agent systems

**Total Learning Time** : 120-150 minutes (including code execution and exercises)
