**Techniques for extracting valuable insights from unlabeled data**

## Series Overview

This series is a practical educational content consisting of 4 chapters that allows you to learn unsupervised learning step by step from the basics.

**Unsupervised Learning** is a machine learning technique that discovers hidden patterns and structures from data without correct labels. Through techniques such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection, it enables data understanding, visualization, compression, and anomaly detection, and is widely used in data analysis, marketing, security, and many other fields.

**Features:**

  * ✅ **From basics to practice** : Systematic learning from clustering fundamentals to customer segmentation
  * ✅ **Implementation-focused** : 35+ executable Python code examples, practical projects
  * ✅ **Intuitive understanding** : Understanding algorithm behavior through visualization
  * ✅ **scikit-learn utilization** : Latest implementation methods using industry-standard libraries
  * ✅ **Practical project** : Real-world problem solving through customer segmentation

**Total Learning Time** : 70-90 minutes (including code execution and exercises)
