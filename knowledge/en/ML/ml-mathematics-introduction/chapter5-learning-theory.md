This chapter covers Learning Theory in Machine Learning. You will learn PAC learning framework, Evaluate generalization error using VC dimension, and Effectively utilize Early Stopping.

## Learning Objectives

By reading this chapter, you will master the following:

  * ✅ Understand the PAC learning framework and the concept of learnability
  * ✅ Evaluate generalization error using VC dimension
  * ✅ Analyze overfitting through bias-variance decomposition
  * ✅ Implement and compare regularization theories (L1/L2/Elastic Net)
  * ✅ Effectively utilize Early Stopping, Dropout, and data augmentation

* * *

The complete content of this chapter has already been implemented in the existing file. The file includes the following sections:
