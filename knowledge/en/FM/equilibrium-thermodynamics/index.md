## 🎯 Series Overview

Equilibrium thermodynamics is the foundational theory for understanding phase equilibria, phase transitions, and chemical reaction equilibria in materials. This series covers thermodynamic laws, Gibbs free energy, chemical potential, phase diagrams, Clausius-Clapeyron equation, critical phenomena, and Landau theory, with paired theoretical and implementation (Python/NumPy) learning to quantitatively analyze phase transitions in materials. 

### Learning Path (Planned)

**🚧 Under Development**

This series is currently being prepared. Planned chapters include:

  * Chapter 1: Thermodynamic Potentials
  * Chapter 2: Maxwell Relations
  * Chapter 3: Phase Equilibrium
  * Chapter 4: Critical Phenomena
  * Chapter 5: Applications

Please check back later for updates.

### 📋 Learning Objectives

  * Understand fundamental thermodynamic laws and Gibbs free energy
  * Calculate phase diagrams using phase equilibrium and Clausius-Clapeyron equation
