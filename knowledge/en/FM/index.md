## 🎓 About Foundational Mathematics Dojo

The Foundational Mathematics Dojo is a cross-cutting series that provides **mathematical foundations across all domains (PI/MS/MI/ML)**. Students learn mathematical tools essential to materials science, process engineering, and machine learning—including mathematical physics, statistical mechanics, probability theory, and numerical computing—pairing theory with implementation (Python code). 

**Key Features:** Each series is structured in cycles of "theory → examples → implementation → exercises," deepening understanding not just through equations but through hands-on Python coding. Provided in Jupyter Notebook format, learners can study at their own pace interactively. Progressive instruction spans from foundational basics for beginners to advanced applications useful in research.
