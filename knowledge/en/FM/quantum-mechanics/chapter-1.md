## 1.1 Wave Functions and the Schrödinger Equation

### 📚 Fundamental Principles of Quantum Mechanics

**Wave Function** \\(\psi(\mathbf{r}, t)\\) completely describes the quantum state.

**Born's Probabilistic Interpretation** :

\\[ P(\mathbf{r}, t) = |\psi(\mathbf{r}, t)|^2 \\]

**Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation** :

\\[ i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \psi = \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r}) \right) \psi \\]

**Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation** (\\(\psi = \phi(x)e^{-iEt/\hbar}\\)):

\\[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\phi}{dx^2} + V(x)\phi = E\phi \\]

## Summary

In this chapter, we learned the foundations of wave mechanics. The **wave function** provides a complete description of quantum states through its probabilistic interpretation. The **Schrodinger equation** serves as the fundamental equation governing quantum mechanics. We explored the **particle in a box** model, which demonstrates quantized energy levels, and the **harmonic oscillator** , characterized by equally spaced energy levels and zero-point energy. Finally, the **uncertainty principle** establishes fundamental limits on the simultaneous measurement of position and momentum.

In the next chapter, we will learn about three-dimensional systems and symmetry, particularly the exact solution of the hydrogen atom.
