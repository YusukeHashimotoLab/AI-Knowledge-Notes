## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### Q1: What level of statistics prerequisite knowledge is required?

**A** : Basic statistics knowledge (mean, standard deviation, normal distribution) is sufficient. Necessary statistical methods are explained carefully in each chapter and can be learned practically with Python code examples.

### Q2: What is the difference between this series and the process control series?

**A** : While the process control series focuses on "real-time control and automation," this series focuses on "quality evaluation, management, and improvement." Combining both enables optimal operation while ensuring quality.

### Q3: Can this be applied to actual manufacturing sites?

**A** : Yes. All code examples are designed with practical application in mind. However, during implementation, please comply with on-site safety regulations, data security, and regulatory requirements.

### Q4: Which Python libraries are required?

**A** : We primarily use NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, and scikit-learn. For SPC, we use statistics, and for quality prediction, we utilize machine learning libraries.

### Q5: What should I learn next?

**A** : We recommend the following topics:  
\- **Design of Experiments (DOE)** : Efficient quality improvement experiments  
\- **Reliability Engineering** : Failure rate analysis, FMEA, FTA  
\- **Manufacturing Data Analysis** : Big data, IoT, digital twin
