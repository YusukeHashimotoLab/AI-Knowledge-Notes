                <h3>Q1: Who is the target audience for this series?</h3>
                <p>
                    Quality control personnel in pharmaceutical manufacturing, manufacturing engineers, data scientists,
                    and graduate students majoring in pharmacy or chemical engineering. Understanding is possible with basic knowledge of GMP/GMPDP.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q2: Is knowledge of GMP and CSV mandatory?</h3>
                <p>
                    Basic understanding of GMP requirements is recommended, but this series explains necessary regulatory requirements
                    together with implementation examples. CSV practice is covered in detail in Chapter 5.
                </p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q3: Is application to actual manufacturing lines possible?</h3>
                <p>
                    Code examples in this series are designed <strong>assuming GMP compliance</strong>.
                    However, actual manufacturing application requires individual qualification assessments including CSV, audit trails, and change management.
                    Chapter 5 explains implementation strategies in detail.

                <h3>Q4: Does this cover both batch and continuous manufacturing?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes. Chapters 1-2 cover quality control in batch manufacturing, and Chapters 3-4 cover PAT and continuous manufacturing.
                    Transition strategies from batch to continuous are also explained in detail in Chapter 4.

                <h3>Q5: What is the relationship with other Process Informatics Dojo series?</h3>
                <p>
                    This is positioned as an advanced edition of "AI Applications to Chemical Plants".
                    While the fundamental technologies are common, this series focuses on pharmaceutical-specific GMP requirements, batch management,
                    and regulatory compliance.
