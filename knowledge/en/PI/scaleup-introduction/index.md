## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### Q1: How much prerequisite knowledge in chemical engineering is needed?

**A** : Basic knowledge of fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and mass transfer is desirable. Understanding dimensionless number concepts and reaction engineering fundamentals (residence time, yield, etc.) will enable smooth learning.

### Q2: What is the difference between scale-up and scale-down?

**A** : Scale-up is enlarging from small scale (lab, pilot) to large scale (commercial plant), while scale-down is the opposite. Scale-down is important for designing pilot experiments and determining lab experimental conditions from commercial plant data.

### Q3: Is scale-up possible without using machine learning?

**A** : Yes, it is possible. Conventional methods based on similarity principles and dimensionless numbers learned in Chapters 1-4 have a long track record and are used as standard in many industries. The machine learning methods in Chapter 5 are additional tools when abundant data is available or higher accuracy predictions are needed.

### Q4: Which Python libraries are needed?

**A** : Primarily NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are used. For machine learning, scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, and TensorFlow/PyTorch are recommended. Chapters 1-4 can be executed with only basic scientific computing libraries.

### Q5: What should I learn next?

**A** : The following topics are recommended:  
\- **Process Modeling** : CFD simulation and digital twins  
\- **Process Control** : Control system design associated with scale changes  
\- **Process Safety** : Safety assessment during scale-up (HAZOP, risk assessment)
