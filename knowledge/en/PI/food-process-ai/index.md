## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: Who is the target audience for this series?

Quality control managers in food manufacturing, manufacturing engineers, food R&D researchers, and graduate students majoring in food science. Understanding is possible with basic knowledge of food science and Python. 

### Q2: How is this different from other chemical processes?

Food processes are characterized by **diversity of raw materials, importance of sensory evaluation, and microbial control**. This series focuses on challenges specific to the food industry, such as quantification of flavor and texture, fermentation control, and HACCP compliance. 

### Q3: Is knowledge of HACCP and GMP required?

Basic understanding is recommended, but this series explains the necessary fundamentals of food safety management. Chapter 4 provides detailed learning on AI implementation of HACCP systems. 

### Q4: How is sensory evaluation data handled?

Chapter 2 provides detailed explanations of statistical analysis of sensory evaluation data, principal component analysis, and machine learning model construction. Learn practically from panel data preprocessing to multivariate analysis. 

### Q5: Is application in actual food factories possible?

The code examples in this series are designed **with actual factory application in mind**. However, food safety requirements, allergen management, and traceability require individual verification. Chapter 5 provides detailed explanations of implementation strategies.
